###CPSC 120
-Lab 5
Because lab 5 involved geometry and numbers in coding, it was one of my favorite labs that we completed during the year. I was able to become well acquainted with statements for this lab. The fact that everything came together nicely made this lab enjoyable for me as well. 
-Lab 11
The fact that lab 11 dealt with counties and numbers added to my enjoyment of the exercise. Learning about while statements and their associated difficulties was interesting to me. In addition, this lab was one of the longest, and I wrote practically all of the code by myself. 
-Lab 4
Because lab 4 dealt with units and converting between different measurements, it was the last experiment that I found to be the most engaging and fun. When I initially started this lab, I felt it to be really difficult because of all the assignment problems. Once I got beyond the mistakes, I thought this lab was really fascinating.
